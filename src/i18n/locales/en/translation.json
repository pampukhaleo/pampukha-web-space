    "description": "Answers to the most common questions about creating SPA websites with React using individual approach and marketing tools.",
    "question1": "What is SPA and why is it better than regular website?",

    "question2": "How long does it take to create a SPA website?",
    "answer2": "Depends on project complexity. Simple landing page - 3-5 days, corporate website - 7-10 days, online store - 2-3 weeks. React allows quick creation of quality components, and Supabase provides ready backend.",
    "question3": "What is included in the base price from $300?",
    "answer3": "Base price includes: React SPA development, responsive design, basic SEO, hosting for a year. Marketing tools (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Analytics etc.) are set up additionally as needed.",
    "question4": "What marketing tools can you set up?",
    "answer4": "I can set up: Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Search Console, Facebook Pixel. I discuss with each client which tools are needed specifically for their business.",

    "answer5": "React is the most popular and stable library for web development. It's used by Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber. Huge community, constant updates, countless ready solutions. Your website will be reliable and easy to maintain.",
    "question6": "What guarantees of website reliability?",
    "answer6": "React ensures high code reliability thanks to component architecture. Supabase guarantees 99.9% uptime. Your website will work stably even under high loads.",
    "question7": "Will I be able to add content myself?",
    "answer7": "Yes! I'll set up a convenient admin panel through Supabase or teach you to work with code. React components are easy to edit. First changes are free, then we can agree on subscription maintenance.",
    "question8": "How does SEO work for SPA?",
    "answer8": "I use Client-Side Rendering and proper meta tag structure. Set up Google Search Console for position tracking. SPAs can rank just as well as regular websites with the right approach.",
