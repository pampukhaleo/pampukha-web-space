    "title1": "Frequently",
    "title2": "asked questions",
    "description": "Answers to the most common questions about creating SPA websites with React and setting up complete marketing package.",
    "question1": "What is SPA and why is it better than regular website?",
    "answer1": "SPA (Single Page Application) is a website that loads once and then works like a mobile app. Instead of reloading the entire page on transitions, only content changes. Result: speed, better UX, higher conversion.",
    "question2": "How long does it take to create a SPA website?",
    "answer2": "Usually 5-7 business days. React + TypeScript allow quick creation of quality components, and Supabase provides ready backend. Most time is spent setting up all marketing tools.",
    "question3": "What exactly is included in the $300 price?",
    "answer3": "Complete package: React SPA development, TypeScript, responsive design, Supabase backend, SEO optimization, Google Ads setup, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, Analytics, Tag Manager, Search Console, hosting for a year.",
    "question4": "Will I be able to track advertising effectiveness?",
    "answer4": "Yes! You'll get complete analytics: how many visitors from each advertising channel, conversions, ROI, user behavior. All in convenient Google Analytics and Facebook Business Manager dashboards.",
    "question5": "What guarantees of website reliability?",
    "answer5": "React + TypeScript ensure high code reliability. Supabase guarantees 99.9% uptime. Your website will work stably even under high loads.",
    "question6": "Will I be able to add content myself?",
    "answer6": "Yes! I'll set up a convenient admin panel through Supabase or teach you to work with code. React components are easy to edit. First changes are free.",
    "question7": "How does SEO work for SPA?",
    "answer7": "I use Server-Side Rendering and proper meta tag structure. Set up Google Search Console for position tracking. SPAs can rank just as well as regular websites.",
    "question8": "What to do after website launch?",
    "answer8": "I'll set up all advertising campaigns and analytics. You'll receive detailed instructions for working with advertising dashboards and optimization recommendations for better results."
