    "question1": "What is SPA and why is it better than regular website?",

    "question2": "How long does it take to create a SPA website?",
    "answer2": "Depends on project complexity. Simple landing page - 3-5 days, corporate website - 7-10 days, online store - 2-3 weeks. React allows quick creation of quality components, and Supabase provides ready backend.",
    "question3": "What is included in the base price from $300?",
    "answer3": "Base price includes: React SPA development, responsive design, basic SEO, hosting for a year. Marketing tools (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Analytics etc.) are set up additionally as needed.",
    "question4": "What marketing tools can you set up?",
    "answer4": "I can set up: Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Search Console, Facebook Pixel. I discuss with each client which tools are needed specifically for their business.",

    "question6": "What guarantees of website reliability?",
    "answer6": "React ensures high code reliability thanks to component architecture. Supabase guarantees 99.9% uptime. Your website will work stably even under high loads.",
    "question7": "Will I be able to add content myself?",
    "answer7": "Yes! I'll set up a convenient admin panel through Supabase or teach you to work with code. React components are easy to edit. First changes are free, then we can agree on subscription maintenance.",
    "question8": "How does SEO work for SPA?",
    "answer8": "I use Client-Side Rendering and proper meta tag structure. Set up Google Search Console for position tracking. SPAs can rank just as well as regular websites with the right approach.",
